<b><a href="https://github.com/auri8en/Projects/tree/main/Cookie%20Cats"> 3) A/B Testing for Cookie Cats Mobile App </a></b>

Cookie Cats is a popular Mobile Game App. This was a simple A/B statistical test to determine which game level would give better user retention. Tests conducted include Levene's, Mann Whitney U Test and a simple Bootstrap sampling. We found that leaving the game at a lower gate level (level 30) yielded better user retention rates.
